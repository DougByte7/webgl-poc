# About

This project is a proof of concept that a I create as I learn WebGL.
It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and TypeScript.

It should be just a spinning triangle, but when I got that I thought "what if I add some light texture and transform handles?" so, this project has the following

## Features

- [x] Error Boundary
- [x] WebGL2 Context renderer
- [x] Weird textured spinning cube
- [x] [Blinn-Phong shading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinn%E2%80%93Phong_reflection_model)
- [x] Play/Pause "animation"
- [x] Transform handles

## To start the project

You can just see it running on the [GitHub Pages](https://dougbyte7.github.io/webgl-poc/)
or
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Future work
* Other illumination types
* Wavefront .obj reader
* Shadow
